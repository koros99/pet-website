    <p>Poppy is his name, and that's just the beginning of adoration. I have a pet you just dream of, I bet. Poppy is a companion befit of the title "man's best friend".<p>
    <p>My day begins with a morning run, in which I bring my dog along. We run about 20 minutes before we both get tired and decide to walk home. We then have our breakfast before I sadly part with Poppy, and go to school. Meanwhile, Poppy stays at home playing with this baseball he can't get enough of. Poppy also loves company and he occasionally sneaks out to hang with Rex, the next door dog.</p>

    <p>How to be friends with Poppy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Buy him bones</li>
      <li>Play throw-and-fetch with his beloved baseball</li>
      <li>Run if he barks</li>
      <li>Don't annoy me, I'll tell on you</li>
    </ul>
